## Project Overview

The "Sepsis Classification with FastAPI" project aims to develop a classification system for sepsis cases using the FastAPI framework. Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical attention. This project addresses the critical need for timely identification and classification of sepsis cases to facilitate prompt treatment and improve patient outcomes.

The objectives of the project are as follows:

1. Train a machine learning model on a diverse dataset of sepsis cases to accurately predict the likelihood of sepsis in patients.

2. Utilize the FastAPI framework to create a user-friendly and efficient web interface for healthcare professionals to interact with the sepsis classification model.

3. Improve diagnostic capabilities by achieving high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in sepsis classification.

4. Provide a comprehensive and scalable solution that can be easily deployed in real-time healthcare environments.
